You‚Äôll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

üö® STOCK ANALYSIS NOTEBOOK - EXECUTION ORDER IMPORTANT
üìä Currently configured for: NVDA
============================================================
‚ö†Ô∏è This notebook must be run in sequential order (Cell 1 ‚Üí Cell 2 ‚Üí Cell 3...)
‚ö†Ô∏è Each cell depends on variables defined in previous cells
‚ö†Ô∏è If you get 'name not defined' errors, restart kernel and run all cells in order

üìã QUICK TROUBLESHOOTING:
1. If you see 'stock_data is not defined' ‚Üí Run the data fetching cell first
2. If charts don't display ‚Üí Check font setup in the imports cell
3. If predictions fail ‚Üí Ensure ML features are created first

üÜò EMERGENCY FIX AVAILABLE:
‚Ä¢ Cell 4 contains emergency data loading if stock_data is missing
‚Ä¢ This will automatically fetch stock data if not already loaded
‚Ä¢ However, proper order execution is still recommended

‚úÖ BEST PRACTICE: Cell ‚Üí Run All (runs everything in correct order)
‚úÖ QUICK FIX: Run Cell 4 first if you get NameError
